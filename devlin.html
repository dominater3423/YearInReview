            <h3>Janet Devlin</h3>
        </center>
        <h3>Background</h3>
        <p>She was born in somewhere in rural Ireland. At, I believe 16, appeared on X Factor where she was a favorite of the judges and made it pretty far. After that agencies tried to sign her, but she decided to have a go at it as an independent artist.</p>
        <h3>My Favorite Music From Her</h3>

        </ol>
        <p>The fourth and seventh are covers. She has plenty of other music as well on her channel, would recommend.</p>
        <p>Channel: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCb45YJUy9zAzhPaduyMM-_w">here</a></p>
        <p>There's also <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpmnH3aQCYQ">this</a>. Can't say I'm I love the song itself, but the video is great.</p>
        <h3>Confessional</h3>
        <p>This is her new album, which from what I've heard looks quite good. Holy Water is apart of it, which may just be the best thing she's done. The theme of it is exactly what it sounds, a confessional. Which means the songs are more personal. I've always liked songs that combined folk and pop, which this does with its Celtic roots.</p>
